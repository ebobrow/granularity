    abstract = "Most automated theorem provers suffer from the problem that they
                can produce proofs only in formalisms difficult to understand
                even for experienced mathematicians. Effort has been made to
                reconstruct natural deduction (ND) proofs from such machine
                generated proofs. Although the single steps in ND proofs are easy
                to understand, the entire proof is usually at a low level of
                abstraction, containing too many tedious steps. To obtain proofs
                similar to those found in mathematical textbooks, we propose a
                new formalism, called ND style proofs at the assertion level,
                where derivations are mostly justified by the application of a
                definition or a theorem. After characterizing the structure of
                compound ND proof segments allowing assertion level justification
                , we show that the same derivations can be achieved by
                domain-specific inference rules as well. Furthermore, these rules
                can be represented compactly in a tree structure. Finally, we
                describe a system called PROVERB, which substantially shortens ND
                proofs by abstracting them to the assertion level and then
                transforms them into natural language.",

                derived from arbitrary axioms, definitions, theorems, as well as
                local hypotheses -- collectively called assertions. Each derived
                deduction rule represents a pattern of larger SK-derivations
                corresponding to the use of that assertion. The idea of
                metadeduction is to get shorter and more concise formal proofs by
                allowing the replacement of any assertion in the antecedent of a
                sequent by derived deduction rules that are available locally for
                proving that sequent. We prove the soundness and completeness for
                atomic metadeduction, which builds upon a permutability property
